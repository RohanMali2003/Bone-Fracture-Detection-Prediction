# GitHub Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- Git installed on your computer
- Python and required dependencies installed

## Step 1: Prepare Your Project

1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**
   - Make sure you've run all cells in the `Bone_Fracture_Prediction_&_Detection.ipynb` notebook
   - Verify that the models have been saved in the `model_weights` directory

2. **Test the Streamlit App Locally**
   ```bash
   # Install required dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Run the Streamlit app
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. **Organize Sample Data (Optional)**
   - Create a small sample dataset in the `data` folder if you want to include it in the repository
   - Alternatively, document how users can obtain the dataset

## Step 2: Initialize Git Repository

1. **Open Command Prompt/Terminal**
   - Navigate to your project folder:
   ```bash
   cd c:\Users\rohan\Downloads\Bone-Fracture-Detection-Prediction-main (1)\Bone-Fracture-Detection-Prediction-main
   ```

2. **Initialize Git Repository**
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

3. **Add Your Files to Git**
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

4. **Commit Your Changes**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit - Bone Fracture Detection Project"
   ```

## Step 3: Push to GitHub

1. **Create a New GitHub Repository**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name it "Bone-Fracture-Detection-Prediction"
   - Keep it public or private as per your preference
   - Do not initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

2. **Connect Local Repository to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YourUsername/Bone-Fracture-Detection-Prediction.git
   ```
   - Replace `YourUsername` with your GitHub username

3. **Push Your Code to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   - If the above command fails, try: `git push -u origin master`

## Step 4: Verify Deployment

1. **Check Your GitHub Repository**
   - Go to https://github.com/YourUsername/Bone-Fracture-Detection-Prediction
   - Ensure all your files are uploaded correctly

2. **Update README with Streamlit Demo Link (Optional)**
   - If you decide to deploy on Streamlit Sharing, add the link to your README

## Step 5: Deploy to Streamlit Sharing (Optional)

1. **Go to Streamlit Sharing**
   - Visit https://share.streamlit.io/

2. **Deploy Your App**
   - Connect to your GitHub repository
   - Select the repository and main file (app.py)
   - Click "Deploy"

3. **Share Your App**
   - Get the public URL for your Streamlit app
   - Share it with others to demonstrate your project
