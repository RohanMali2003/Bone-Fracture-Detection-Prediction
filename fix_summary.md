# Bone Fracture Detection App - Fix Summary

## Issue Identified

- UI displayed contradictory results where the heading showed "Diagnosis: Fracture" but the message below said "No fracture detected"

## Root Cause

- In app.py, the UI logic wasn't properly checking the result string from the model
- In model.py, there were code formatting and indentation issues that could lead to unpredictable behavior

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed app.py UI Logic

- Ensured that when displaying results in app.py, we:
  - Check for the exact strings "Fracture" or "No Fracture" returned by the model
  - Display consistent messages that match the diagnosis heading

### 2. Fixed model.py Indentation Issues

- Fixed indentation in the extract_features method
- Fixed indentation in the predict_fracture method
- Ensures consistent return value formats: "Fracture" or "No Fracture"

### 3. Verified Changes

- Created and ran a test script (check_ui_logic.py) that simulates the app's display logic
- Confirmed that both heading and message are consistent for:
  - Case 1: Fractured bone (prediction=0) → Shows "Diagnosis: Fracture" with matching warning
  - Case 2: Non-fractured bone (prediction=1) → Shows "Diagnosis: No Fracture" with matching success message

## Conclusion

The app now displays consistent diagnosis results between the heading and the message, ensuring users receive clear and non-contradictory information about the detected bone condition.
